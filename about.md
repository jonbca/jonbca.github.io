Howdy, there. I consult and develop software for [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) in the United Kingdom.

Originally from the cold white North of Canada, I can nowadays be found living and working in temperate Glasgow, Scotland. I enjoy delicious coffee, craft beer, and oxford commas.

Please get in touch with me any time!
